# Python-Scripts
Some of my pythons projects
There are many scripts here that I found useful to develop my skills they are mostly simple stuff like a voice counter
and some automations like send messages text to whatsapp.
Some of them instead of going straight using selenium, uses manual automated commands and sending the whatsapp message through a Android Emulator
caled NOX so its a pre require depending of the script.
